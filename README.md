# VHDL-MODULES
A collection of VHDL modules to be used in projects and design. The following modules are provided:

  - ALUs/alu: a simple ALU able to perform addition, subtraction and the AND/OR/XOR/NAND/NOR/XNOR bitwise logical operations.
  - Adders/carry_select_adder: a simple carry select adder based on ripple-carry adders.
  - Adders/ripple_carry_adder: the simplest structural ripple-carry adder made of a chain of full adders.
  - Adders/sparse_tree_adder: a valence-2 Sklansky sparse tree adder similar to the Intel Pentium 4's one.
  - Counters/programmable_counter: a programmable counter allowing for up/downcounting, custom value counting, one-shot/repeated counting and endowed with a prescaler.
  - Counters/synchronous_counter: a synchronous upcounter allowing for custom value counting.
  - Logicals/bitwise_logical_calculator: a bitwise AND/OR/XOR/NAND/NOR/XNOR calculator based on a two-level NAND structure.
